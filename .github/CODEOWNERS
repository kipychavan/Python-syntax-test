# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# More details are here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/

# The '*' pattern is global owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# The folders are ordered as follows:

# In each subsection folders are ordered first by depth, then alphabetically.
# This should make it easy to add new rules without breaking existing ones.

# Global rule:
*   @Bharath-Kumar-RNDC @aakash-sharma-rndc @abhishek-gupta-rndc @Mark-S-Kelley @cwobutch

# any changes to dag_creation.py and dag_template.jinja2 files in dynamic_dags directory requires an approval from  #@kipgbhatt & @sridevi-kipi
